## Architecture Diagram Reference

- The project architecture is documented in [architecture.diagram](architecture.diagram).
- This diagram provides a visual overview of all major components, their relationships, and operational flow.
- All agents MUST read and understand the diagram before starting any project-related tasks.
- Agents MUST keep the diagram up to date using the DiagramFlow tools; never modify the diagram file directly.

**Diagram Description:**
- Illustrates the extension entry, DiagramEditorProvider, DiagramService, LM tools, core libraries, and webview components.
- Shows how user actions, Copilot, and tools interact with the extension and diagram services.
- Essential for understanding dependencies and operational flow.
