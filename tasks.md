[] agent should be able to modify file in real time, and i should see the changes immidiately. This allows for dynamic updates and ensures that the most current information is always available.
[] we need to have save and "export" that allows us to save the file as a new file as svg or png as well. (the diagram metadata should be saved in the file as well, so that when we open the file again, we can see the diagram as it was before). Export default path it is next to the original file, with the same name but with .svg or .png extension.
[] improve "layout" feature, it should be called auto layout and will reorganize items in a way that is more clear and easy to understand. The edges should not overlap, and it should find best routes between nodes so it is easier to read.
[] improve editing nodes and edges, we need to be able to edit it completely, from node type, color, edge type, color, etc... All what is available currenty.
[] do a research what kind of information is needed in the diagram to make the LLM/coding agent understand the architecture and flow of the application. This may include information about the different components, their interactions, data flow, and any relevant technologies or frameworks used. Format should be simple and easy to understand by the agent. (make it part of the diagram metadata, and make it obvious to an agent that is the information for the agent. So agent can always understand it no matter if vs code extension is installed or not). This agent metadata has to be autogenerate based on the file content, and should be updated every time the file is changed. This way we can ensure that the agent always has the most up-to-date information about the application architecture and flow. (our tool is doing this, not the agent). Document the research in a new md file.
[] do a research and analayze which features are needed for the diagram editor to be more useful for the developers and the coding agent. Be creative and suggest at least 10 different features. Document the research in a new md file.
[] reorganize and rename file inside the information folder to make it more clear and easy to understand.
